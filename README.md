## My process

- HTML skeleton with HTML Boilerplate containing default modernizer and normalizer CSS properties,
- Finalising HTML skeleton,
- Typography,
- Alignments and furthur designing,
- Finalising everything and solving existing problems,
- Testing in all screens and making Media Queries if necessary,
- Deployment and Cross-Testing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup,
- CSS custom properties,
- Flexbox,
- Mobile-first workflow,
- Pseudo-classes and pseudo-element.

### What I learned

- Switching between two Images using :hover,
- Getting better on aligment and giving spaces between elements and using viewport units when necessary,
- Getting more practice on Mobile-first layouts.

### Continued development

- Giving some thought to Accessibility and backward compatibility.
